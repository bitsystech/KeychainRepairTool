# KeychainRepairTool

This is a simple tool that has been put up together. Here is what happens -

1. Checks who is logged in
2. Shows notification with help of Cocoa Dialog
3. Deletes the login.keychain
3. Informs user again that new key chain will be created
4. Prompts user to enter password
5. Using Expect password is taking and sent ahead to create a new Keychain
6. Complete. User is happy. He does not need to call Helpdesk as this application can be deployed via Kiosk / Self Service.


This was a quickly written and can be refined for use in your organization.
All the best!!
